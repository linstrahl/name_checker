# MetaTrader Name Match Checker

**Name Match Checker** is a Streamlit-based application used to match trading account Login and Name data against the master data from MetaTrader 5 (MT5). This application helps users easily verify whether the entered account data matches the official data in the master CSV file.

# ✨ Key Features

- 📤 Upload the MT5 master trading accounts file in CSV format.
- 📝 Input account data manually using the format:
    ```bash
    number login name
    ```

    Example:
    ```bash
    1 123456 John Doe
    2 987654 Jane Smith
    ```

- 🔎 Automatic matching between input and master file:
  -  ✔ Match → input name exactly matches the master file.
  -  ❌ Not Match → mismatch is detected, with a similarity score as reference.
  -  🚫 Data not found → login ID is missing from the master file.

- 📑 Summary of results:
  - Total matches
  - Total mismatches
  - List of detailed comparison results
